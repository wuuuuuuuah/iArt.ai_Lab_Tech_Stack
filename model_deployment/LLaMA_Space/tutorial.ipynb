    "(1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.\n",
    "(2) The speed of light is constant in all inertial reference frames.\n",
    "The second of these principles has allowed us to prove the first.\n",
    "Before Einstein, scientists believed that the speed of light was constant in all frames, but that the speed of light was not constant. This was called the constancy of the speed of light hypothesis. In the late 19th century, scientists such as Michelson and Morley and Lorentz had set up experiments to test this hypothesis.\n",
    "For example, when Michelson and Morley set up their Michelson-Morley interferometer, they expected that the light would take a different path depending on whether it was moving at the same speed as the Earth or at a different speed. They found that it didn't, but the constancy of the speed of light hypothesis said that it would.\n",

    "What is it that you need to do? Do you want people to buy a product, do you want to have a blog or do you want to provide a service? These are all different types of websites. The type of website you need will have a large impact on how you design your website.\n",
    "2. Do you want a responsive website?\n",
    "Some websites are better suited for a mobile or tablet. If you are planning to have a mobile site, then it is recommended to have a responsive website. This allows your website to be displayed on any device.\n",
    "3. What is your target audience?\n",
    "Having a clear idea of who your target audience is can help you design a website that will be targeted to them. Also, you will be able to know how to market your website and get people to your website.\n",
    "4. What are you going to use?\n",
    "There are many different web designing platforms. Some are free and others cost money. There are pros and cons to both types of websites.\n",
    "5. Decide on the look and feel\n",
